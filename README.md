# Ship-Captain-Crew-ConsoleApplication

This is the dice game of "Ship, Captain and Crew" made in a console app for multiple players.
This was an assignment I did for a 4th year software module that was an introduction to threading, tasks and isolated storage with C#. 
Each player is represented using a thread and all the game settings are saved to isolated storage.
